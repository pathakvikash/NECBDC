          <p>
            North East Cane and Bamboo Development Council has facilitated the
            emergence of a new scenario in the North Eastern India. Almost two
            decades of its existence in this part of India has struck the
            imaginations of the population here and led them on to dream about
            the possibility of a healthy future. Inevitably a future replete
            with expanded livelihood opportunities stemming unendingly from the
            right and rich harvest of Bamboos. NECBDC strongly believe in the
            thrust which will be felt globally following our role as the
            matchmaker of the human resource, bamboo and technology.
            <br />
            NECBDC was incorporated with the objective of organizing the
            hitherto untapped bamboo sector of NE India which is a significant
            occupant of its topography, culture and customary practices since
            time immemorial. Its formal existence came into being as a
            coordinated effort headed by North Eastern development Finance
            Corporation (NEDFi) along with the Department of Science and
            Technology, Govt of India, UNIDO and UNDP. NECBDC is the field
            implementation agency and forms a part of the Technology Management
            Program (TMP) which is a joint effort of Govt of India and UNDP.
            NECBDC has embarked on a new phase of programmes and projects in the
            bamboo sector with renewed vigor under the aegis of North Eastern
            Council (NEC). It can be said that NECBDC is one of core outreach
            programme of NEC for giving a shift to the economy of NE in the
            positive direction. The progress of these two organizations has been
            acknowledged by the greater community as the change agent whose need
            was continually felt in the region.
